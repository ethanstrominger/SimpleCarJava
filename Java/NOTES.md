Maintain a list of cars and their ID, make, model, and color.
----------------------------------
TO DO:
- Switch to JavaScript project (and copy this stuff there):
        - Try hello world new js test in Ethan's existing calendar js project
        - Test 1: I can create a car.
        - Test 1a: When you create a second car, it uses a different id
        - Test 2: I can get a specific car by ID.
        - Test 3: I can get a list of cars that match a specific color.
        - Test 4: I can delete a car by ID.
        - Clean up this document (rename, TOC,...)     
        Future Refactoring:
        - (Ethan) Figure out how to exclude .idea files
        - (Joel) Try opening this project in Visual Studio (may require something different)     
        - (Not Needed / Abandoned - Install ES 6 (Joel's PC) & Resolve GitHub permission issue (Joel - push to Ethan's Simple Car JavaScript - or use Joel's fork))
- Time how much time we're coding & try to increase
- Modify mob timer source code to add "stand" reminder (1) text, (2) text to speech (TTS) 
  [and consider other improvements]
- Add license
- Refactor Java Hashtable loops
----------------------------------
DONE:
- Test 4: I can delete a car by ID.
- Test 3: I can get a list of cars that match a specific color.
- (not a feature) AnyDesk remote control: Compare AnyDesk to Zoom - latency? keyboard?
  *** Do Zoom first, then Any Desk ***
  *** Try copy-paste, etc., speed of typing, highlighting with mouse ***
  *** On first commit: Add Joel as a co-author ***
- Test 2: I can get a specific car by ID.
- Refactor: ID is not currently thread-safe - consider Java UID function
- Test 1a: When you create a second car, it uses a different id
- Test 1: I can create a car.
