Maintain a list of cars and their ID, make, model, and color.

TO DO:
- (EVERY TIME: Review previous retro at beginning of each session)
- Add Joel as a co-author
- Use both Joel's and Ethan's computers - just get from Git before drive each time
- Test 3: I can get a list of cars that match a certain criteria.
- Test 4: I can delete a car by ID.

----------------------------------
DONE:
- Test 2: I can get a specific car by ID.
- Refactor: ID is not currently thread-safe - consider Java UID function
- Test 1a: When you create a second car, it uses a different id
- Test 1: I can create a car.
----------------------------------
RETRO IMPROVEMENTS:
- Review previous retro at beginning of each session
- Use both Joel's and Ethan's computers - just get from Git before drive each time
- Compare AnyDesk to Zoom - latency? keyboard?
- Rotate on green (after red-green or after refactor-commit) (mob timer 5 min. as backup max. time) 
- Try retros every 30 min (timer loops every 35 min)
- Break after 2nd retro (maybe set timer for break as backup)  
- Use Git & commit and push every TDD cycle - and at end of session
- Deferred: Better keyboard situation? (Control Mac from PC better)

GOOD / keep doing: 
- Added TDD pre-step: Determine the simplest requirement to move forward
- Got tests done; did TDD (all steps), took turns
- Discussed expectations in beginning
- Expected complexity
