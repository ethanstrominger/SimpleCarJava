Maintain a list of cars and their ID, make, model, and color.

TO DO:
- Refactor: ID is not currently thread-safe - consider Java UID function
- Test 2: I can get a specific car by ID.
- Test 3: I can get a list of cars that match a certain criteria.
- Test 4: I can delete a car by ID.

----------------------------------
DONE:
- Test 1a: When you create a second car, it uses a different id
- Test 1: I can create a car.
----------------------------------
RETRO IMPROVEMENTS:
- Better keyboard situation? (Control Mac from PC better)
- Try diff video tool (not Zoom) - latency? keyboard?
- Try shorter rotations (< 5 min - experiment) or finish full TDD cycle
- Try retros every 20 min
- Use Git & commit every TDD cycle (later: push)

GOOD / keep doing: 
- Added TDD pre-step: Determine the simplest requirement to move forward
- Got tests done; did TDD (all steps), took turns
- Discussed expectations in beginning
- Expected complexity
