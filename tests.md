Maintain a list of cars and their ID, make, model, and color.

TO DO:
- Test 3: I can get a list of cars that match a certain criteria.
    *** On first commit: Add Joel as a co-author ***
- Use both Joel's and Ethan's computers - just get from Git before drive each time
- Test 4: I can delete a car by ID.
- This is a test this is much better
----------------------------------
DONE:
- (not a feature) AnyDesk remote control: Compare AnyDesk to Zoom - latency? keyboard?
  *** Do Zoom first, then Any Desk ***
  *** Try copy-paste, etc., speed of typing, highlighting with mouse ***
- Test 2: I can get a specific car by ID.
- Refactor: ID is not currently thread-safe - consider Java UID function
- Test 1a: When you create a second car, it uses a different id
- Test 1: I can create a car.
----------------------------------
RETRO IMPROVEMENTS:
- Rotate on green (after red-green or after refactor-commit) (mob timer 5 min. as backup max. time) 
- Try retros every 30 min (timer loops every 35 min)

GOOD / keep doing: 
- Added TDD pre-step: Determine the simplest requirement to move forward
- Got tests done; did TDD (all steps), took turns
- Discussed expectations in beginning
- Expected complexity
----------------------------------

AGENDA (during meeting)

Before Coding:

- Review: (1) Previous Retro, (2) TDD steps (see details below) 
- Set Timers for (1) Retros (recurring), (2) Break, (3) Mob Timer (https://mobti.me/calm-harp)

TDD Cycles:

- Requirement - determine the simplest requirement to move forward 
- Red - write a failing test
- Green – write the simplest code to pass
- Commit – save to local repository
- Refactor - improve the code without changing or introducing new behavior (or explicitly state if you don't see anything to refactor) 
- Commit and Push – save to remote common repository 

Agreements (evolve as needed):

- Code by intent – let the tool create classes, variables, etc.
- Bias toward action - let people try things rather than having long debates and speculation; if needed, try it multiple ways and see how it works; always get at least one test done and working at every meeting as a bare minimum (full cycle of red-green-refactor, etc.)
- Retrospectives - after every _30_ minutes on what we learned & liked, and proposed changes (e.g., modifying agreements, processes, etc., as appropriate) (remember to set recurring timer)
- Rotations – rotate roles (driver, navigator, etc.) - after each green (red-green or refactor-commit) up to a max of _5_ minutes 
- Breaks – e.g., every _60_ min. (+/-) (remember to set timer)
