Maintain a list of cars and their ID, make, model, and color.

TO DO (JAVASCRIPT):

- Test 1: I can create a car.
- Test 1a: When you create a second car, it uses a different id
- Test 2: I can get a specific car by ID.
- Test 3: I can get a list of cars that match a specific color.
- Test 4: I can delete a car by ID.  
- Clean up this document (rename, TOC,...)

Future Refactorings:
- (Ethan) Figure out how to exclude .idea files
- (Joel) Try opening this project in Visual Studio (may require something different)
