Maintain a list of cars and their ID, make, model, and color.

TO DO (JAVASCRIPT):
- Try hello world new js test in Ethan's existing calendar js project
- Test 1: I can create a car.
- Test 1a: When you create a second car, it uses a different id
- Test 2: I can get a specific car by ID.
- Test 3: I can get a list of cars that match a specific color.
- Test 4: I can delete a car by ID.  
- Clean up this document (rename, TOC,...)

Future Refactorings:
- (Ethan) Figure out how to exclude .idea files
- (Joel) Try opening this project in Visual Studio (may require something different)

Not Needed:
- (Abandoned - Install ES 6 (Joel's PC) & Resolve GitHub permission issue (Joel - push to Ethan's Simple Car JavaScript - or use Joel's fork))
